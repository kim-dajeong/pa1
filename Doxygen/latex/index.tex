Bugs will arise when packet drops are introduced between two competing instances of our file transfer protocol. Other than that it should work smooth as butter over a lossless high performance network or running alone without a competing instance of another UDP reliable transfer protocol. It works fine with TCP as well. Have fun testing it!

The project was fun! But difficult! Testing it seemed to be a challenge as we haven\textquotesingle{}t learnt much about network testing in C or industry practice for testing other than the labs (which were in python). It would have been nice to have some autograded prarielearn tests just for base testing. Overall, we had fun but the project was a lot of hard work.

Please refer two the attached png files in the doxygen directory that show our wireshark tests for E3 and E4 with no dropped packets.
