main function to call receiver function and pass UDPport and destination filename 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em arcg} & argument count, indicating number of arguments passed from the command line \\
\hline
{\em argv} & argument vector, pointing to an array of strings, each of which contains an argument passed from the command line\\

\end{DoxyParams}

0 
\end{DoxyReturn}
initialize variable to hold udp\+Port name passed from the command line

Check if all three arguments were passed from the command line

Parse the command-\/line arguments

Call the rrecv function with the provided arguments, passing 0 for write\+Rate

return 0 and end\Hypertarget{receiver_8c_ab41fdd85753470e49e9439d9e096947b}\label{receiver_8c_ab41fdd85753470e49e9439d9e096947b}

receiver function for receiving data packets and sending acknowledgements back to client 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em my\+UDPport} & hostport \\
\hline
{\em destination\+FIle} & pointer to destination\+File where received ata will be written \\

{\em write\+Rate} & not used\\

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
void 
\end{DoxyReturn}
Initalizing file I/O and test that the file exists, opening in write only mode

Initalizing address struct and the structure of the clients address for receiving

Create UDP socket and check it exists

Bind socket to the receive address

acknowledgement flag value holder, initialized to 0

index for data packets, initialized to 0

pointer to memory for storing data to send

pointer to memory for storing data received

pointer to address of acknowledgement flag

pointer to address of finish flag

pointer to address of data

pointer to address of data index

Set size of buffer and assign memory block to pointers

Set acknowledgement flag pointer to first byte of memory storing data to send

Set pointers to respective byte of memory storing received data

While loop to continue receiving data and sending acknowledgements until a finish flag is received

reset memory blocks to null

Wait for sender to send message, and store size of message in variable client\+\_\+message

Variable to hold value of finish flag received

Variable to hold value of index received

Copy data stored at address of finpointer and indexpointer into variable to use for comparisons

Check if the recvfrom function received has size greater than 0

Set acknowledgement to 0, indicating a nack flag meaning data transfer was not successful Copy value of acknowledgement flag into memory

Send nack flag to sender

Check if value of finish flag is set to 1, in which case the while loop must be exited

Set acknowledgement flag high, to indicate that the finish flag was received to the sender

Copy value of acknowledgement flag into memory

Send the acknowledgement to the sender, then exit the while loop

Check if the index of the data is equal to the index count of the receiver

Write the data from the data portion of the received memory

Check if write was successful

Set acknowledgement flag high, to indicate that the correct index was received to the sender

Copy value of acknowledgement flag into memory

Send the acknowledgement to the sender

Increment the index keeping count of how many successful data packets were received and written to the destination

If none of the above conditions were met, assume that the index of the data packet was incorrect or no data was received during the bounds of the timeout period

Set acknowledgement flag low, to indicate that an incorrect index was received to the sender

Copy value of acknowledgement flag into memory

Copy value of current index to be received into memory

Send the nack to the sender

Set the acknowledgement flag low

This is the end of the while loop.

Close the destination file opened for writing

Close the socket conneciton

Write rate not implemented
